# MidTerm_Graph-Nodes

Project for the exam of "Inteface Programming" at University of Pisa developed in three days.

The project consists in a simple graphical control that allows you to edit graphs. A suitable clickable area allows the addition of nodes and arcs. The nodes can be moved with the aid of the mouse, moreover appropriate clickable areas allow the elimination of nodes and arcs eventually selected. There are clickable areas for view control (scrolling, rotation and zoom). A clickable area allows to animate the graph when selecting and dragging any node as if they were objects connected to each other by elastic bands.
